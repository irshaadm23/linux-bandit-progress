 # Bandit Level 12 → Level 13

## Goal
Extract a file that has been repeatedly compressed and stored as a hexdump.

## Commands Used
xxd  
file  
gzip  
bzip2  
tar  
mkdir  
cp  

## Process
1. Converted hexdump back to binary using `xxd -r`.
2. Used `file` to detect compression type.
3. Repeatedly decompressed (gzip, bzip2, tar).
4. Eventually obtained a file containing the password.

## Final Command (first step)
xxd -r data.txt > data

## Password
[redacted]
