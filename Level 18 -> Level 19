# Bandit Level 18 → Level 19

## Goal
Read the file "readme" despite .bashrc force logging you out.

## Commands Used
ssh with:  
ssh -t  
or  
ssh 'command'

## Process
1. Normal login logs out instantly because .bashrc calls "exit".
2. Bypassed by executing a command directly with SSH.

## Final Command
ssh bandit18@localhost -p2220 "cat readme"

## Password
[redacted]
