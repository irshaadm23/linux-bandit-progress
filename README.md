# Linux Bandit Progress (Levels 1–20)

This repository documents my progress through the **OverTheWire Bandit** wargame as part of the Linux module in the CoderCo DevOps Program.  
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate my ability to:

- navigate a Linux environment  
- use essential shell commands  
- solve real-world permission, networking and file-handling problems  
- document my troubleshooting process clearly  
- work with GitHub professionally  

Each level includes:
- the **goal**
- the **commands I used**
- my **reasoning / process**
- the **final solution**
- the password (redacted)
