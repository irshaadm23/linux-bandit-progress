# Bandit Level 1 → Level 2

## Goal
Read the password stored in a file called "-" located in the home directory.

## Commands Used
ls  
cat ./-

## Process
1. Listed files using `ls` and found a file named `-`.
2. Using `cat -` doesn't work because "-" is interpreted as stdin.
3. To treat "-" as a literal file, you must reference it with a path: `./-`.

## Final Command
cat ./-

## Password
[redacted]
